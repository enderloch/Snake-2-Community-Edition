## Release Creation Process

Before proceeding, always ensure you're working with the latest version of the code to prevent overwriting fixes from previous versions. 

Follow the steps below to generate a new release:

1. Download the project's zip file.

2. Execute the Python file within the zip. If you haven't installed Python yet, get it from the [Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/store/apps/9P7QFQMJRFP7). 

3. Install the required libraries by pasting the following commands into your terminal:

```shell
pip install pygame
pip install screeninfo
```

4. Navigate to the project's 'releases' page and click 'Draft a new release'.

5. Use the provided template, filling out the necessary details in the 'Write' section.

6. Upload the project's zip file to the 'Attach binaries' section.

7. When titling your release, follow this convention:

   `vX.Y.Z`

   - `v`: Denotes 'version'
   - `X`: Represents major updates. An increment in this number must be approved and signifies significant changes.
   - `Y`: Denotes content updates
   - `Z`: Corresponds to patches or bug fixes

For example, a jump from `v1.0.0` to `v1.0.1` indicates a patch release. A new content update resets the patch number, and a major update resets both the patch and content numbers.

8. Tag the release with the same name as your release title.

9. Finally, publish the release!

Ensure that each commit includes the following copyright statement in the source code:

Download at your own risk!

In order to create a release:

First, have the zip downloaded.

Then, use the template: Run the (python file name) file after installing python on the microsoft store, then pasting "pip install pygame" into command line.

Go to releases, click draft a release.

Paste the template and fill it out in the write section.

Upload the .zip to the "attach binaries" box.

Make the title using this scheme:

Ex: v1.0.0

v for version

1 goes up for EXTREME CHANGES (must be approved)

0 is for content updates

0 is for patches

v1.(content update).(patch version)

Based on last update

Goes like this v1.0.0 would go to v1.0.1, but if there was a new content update, it would reset the patch number, extreme update resets patch and content number.

Make a tag with the same name as the release.

Then just create the release.
